LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE
//Singly Linked List is a linear data structure where each node points to the next node in the sequence. It is a dynamic data structure that can grow and shrink in size as needed. The first node is called the head, and the last node points to null.
	- Singly Linked List
	- Doubly Linked List
	- Circular Linked List
	- Circular Doubly Linked List

STL : Standard Template Library

It provides built in functions, built in classes, and libraries
It contains: 1.container - vector ,list ,set, map,stack, queues
 			 2.iterators - pointer used to traverse the container
 			 3.algorithms - sort, search, reverse, find, etc. 
 			 4.function objects = special object that behaves like a function. 
	containers: sequence, associative, and unordered associative containers.
	- Sequence containers : store elements in a linear sequence. They allow for random access to elements and provide iterators for traversing the container. Examples include vector, list, deque, and array.
	- Associative containers : store elements in a sorted order based on keys. They provide fast searching, insertion, and deletion based on keys. Examples include set, multiset, map, and multimap.
	- Unordered associative containers : store elements in an unordered fashion based on hash values. They provide fast searching, insertion, and deletion based on hash values. Examples include unordered_set, unordered_multiset, Hash_map, and unordered_multimap.


	- Vector : Dynamic array that can grow and shrink in size. It provides random access to elements and is implemented as a dynamic array.
	- List : Doubly linked list that allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements at any position.
	- Deque : Double-ended queue that allows for insertion and deletion of elements at both ends.
	- Stack : LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure that allows for insertion and deletion of elements from the top.
	- Queue : FIFO (First In First Out) data structure that allows for insertion and deletion of elements from the front and back.
	- Priority Queue : A queue where each element has a priority, and elements are dequeued based on their priority rather than their order of insertion.
	- Set : A collection of unique elements that allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion.
	- Map : A collection of key-value pairs that allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion based on keys.

NOTE: what is segmentation fault?
	- Segmentation fault is a specific kind of error caused by accessing memory that "does not belong to you." It's a mechanism that prevents you from corrupting the memory and introducing hard-to-debug memory bugs.
	- It occurs when a program tries to read or write an illegal memory location. This can happen for several reasons, including dereferencing a null pointer, accessing an array out of bounds, or using a pointer that has already been freed.
	- In C/C++, segmentation faults are often caused by dereferencing null or uninitialized pointers, accessing arrays out of bounds, or using pointers after they have been freed. In Python, segmentation faults can occur when using C extensions or when the Python interpreter itself encounters a low-level error.
	- To avoid segmentation faults, it is important to initialize pointers before using them, check for null pointers, and ensure that array indices are within bounds. Additionally, using tools like Valgrind can help detect memory-related errors in C/C++ programs.	


wrute code	for count sort:             // time complexity is O(n+k) and only works for positive integers.
	give input 4228331
	to get output 1223348


	Q6.count nodes in the list
	Q7.find middle element of the linked list
	Q8.remove duplicates from sorted linked list
9. Write a program to check list is circular or not, if not then make it circular double linked list.

queues
operations in queues:
	- enqueue : insert an element at the end of the queue.
	- dequeue : remove an element from the front of the queue.
	- front : get the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
	- rear : get the element at the end of the queue without removing it.
	- isEmpty : check if the queue is empty.
	- isFull : check if the queue is full.
	- size : get the number of elements in the queue.

10. Write a program to reverse a string using Queue. [can use stl operations]
11. Generate binary number from 1 to n using Queue.

Trees 
	- A tree is a non-linear data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. It has a hierarchical structure with a root node at the top and child nodes below it.
	- A binary tree is a tree where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and right child.
	- A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree where the left child of a node contains only nodes with values less than the parent node, and the right child contains only nodes with values greater than the parent node.
	- A balanced binary tree is a binary tree where the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one.
	- A complete binary tree is a binary tree where all levels are completely filled except possibly for the last level, which is filled from left to right.

12. Write a prog to create Bailed binary tree using Queue
BST:[Binary Search Tree]
rule 1: left child < parent node < right child
rule 2:  no duplicate values.

 find the number of platforms required 

Greedy algorithm:
	- A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit. It makes a locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.
	- Greedy algorithms are used in optimization problems where the goal is to find the best solution among many possible solutions.
	- Examples of greedy algorithms include Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree, Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph, and Huffman coding for data compression.

hashing:
double hashing: formula -> h(x) = (h1(x) + i*h2(x)) % m
linear probing: formula -> h(x) = (h1(x) + i) % m
quadratic probing: formula -> h(x) = (h1(x) + i^2) % m
chaining: formula -> h(x) = h1(x) % m
